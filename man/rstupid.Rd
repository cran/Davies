\title{A stupid PDF}
\description{
  a contrived PDF that cannot be closely approximated by a Davies distribution.
}
\usage{
rstupid(n, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4)
}
\arguments{
  \item{n}{Number of observations}
  \item{a}{start of first uniform bit}
  \item{b}{end of first uniform bit}
  \item{c}{start of second uniform bit}
  \item{d}{end of second uniform bit}
}
\details{
 The \code{stupid} distribution is composed of two separate uniform
 distributions: one from a to b, and one from c to d.  It is
 specifically designed to be NOT fittable to any Davies
 distribution.

 You could probably come up with a more stupid distribution
 if you tried.
